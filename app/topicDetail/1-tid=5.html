This kind of musical serendipity is very specific to SoundCloud because of the platform’s unique content.” - TechCrunch, Alex Mozaed “SoundCloud is a great place for finding new music from emerging artists.” - The Next Web, Owen Williams “SoundCloud Go is a big move for the company, which built its business by allowing artists to upload their music and share it with fans on social media and blogs. Acts like Drake, Lily Allen, Kanye West and Miley Cyrus have used it to premiere songs, or share works in progress. It has established the Berlin-based company as an influential player in the music industry, especially in the dance music genre.” - Mark Savage, BBC News COMMUNITY Like what you hear?
